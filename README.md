# Embedded-codes
ALL Codes are using atmega128
t1.c is based on timer1 and calculations are done for 10ms delay using 1024 prescalar
t2.c is based on timer1 without prescalar for checking resolution using timer1
t3.c is based on timer1 without prescalar for 5ms delay
ft.c is flowmeter code using timer1 and for 5ms delay
